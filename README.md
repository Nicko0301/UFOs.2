# UFOs.2
Module 11
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop a user-friendly website containing records of UFO sightings. The table displays data, obtained from eyewitnesses, pertaining to alleged UFO sightings. Filters were added to allow users to sort the information by date, shape of the alleged UFO, the city where it was observed, etc.
## Results
The finished product is an intuitive, easy-to-navigate table containing hundreds of observations. Someone who wanted to narrow the data to include only sightings from her state, for example, would simply need to insert the abbreviated state name in the proper field, and the table would then display only the pertinent data.
## Summary
While the table is fairly straightforward and effective, it does have some limitations. It could use some formatting to make the results more visually appealing, and I would include a button beneath the filters to facilitate searches.
